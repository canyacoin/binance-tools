              This tool uses Binance Chain multi-key store to persist state about multi-signature wallets on-chain and is non-interactive since signers donâ€™t need to be online at the same time.
              Users first set up the wallet by specifying the threshold and maximum number of signatures (such as a 2 of 3 wallet), and then sign in turn to send transactions from the wallet.

              This tool is an adapted multi-signature module that places restrictions on how funds can be spent between parties.
              Users set up details about how the payment should be made, and once both parties are happy, funds are released to the correct recipient.
              The third-party can step in to process disputes and charges a small escrow fee.

            <p class="card-text text-muted">
              This tool is an adapted escrow module that allows a float to be maintained, and an external price reference to be added (such as paying in BNB priced in USD).
              Users specify payment amounts in the price of the external asset such that price volatility risk is removed whilst the asset is escrowed.
              The float in the escrow underwrites payments and as such is very useful for marketplaces.
